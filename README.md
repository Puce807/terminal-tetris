# Terminal Tetris in Python

A classic **Tetris** game playable directly in your terminal, built with **Python**!

---

## 🚀 Features
- Draws a grid given a width and height
- Uses `rich` for colour text formatting

---

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation
> ## ❗ - DISCLAIMER:
> Your IDE terminal may not support cursor manipulation or Rich text formatting. For best results, please use **Command Prompt** or any standard terminal emulator (such as `bash`, `zsh`, `PowerShell`, or your system's default terminal on macOS/Linux). Personally, I prefer the look of terminal tetris in Command Prompt. Only use your IDE if you are debugging or testing! Thank you!
